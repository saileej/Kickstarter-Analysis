# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends

**Overview of Project** This purpose of this project was to examine how different factors have affected the outcomes of past Kickstarter campaigns.  In particular, the effect of campaign launch time (by month) and goal amount of funding were examined.  In addition to conducting a numerical analysis in Excel, graphs were created to visualize the relationship between campaign outcome and target funding, or campaign outcome and month of campaign launch.  Although this project was completed with data from theater campaigns, the included PivotTables can be customized to show trends in campaign outcomes for many different fields (for example, tech products or films).  Understanding the trends observed in this project can help optimize future Kickstarter campaigns.
