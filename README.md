# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends

**Overview of Project** This project analyzed the different factors that influence Kickstarter campaign outcomes.  For the purpose of this project, date of campaign launch (month)  and goal amount of funding (within $10,000 increments) were examined.  In addition to analyzing numerical data, graphs were created to visualize the relationship between campaign outcome (whether the goal amount of funding was raised) and target funding/month of campaign launch.  PivotTables were also created to allow for more customizable analysis of factors affecting campaign outcome.
