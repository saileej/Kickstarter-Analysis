# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends

**Overview of Project** This purpose of this project was to examine how different factors have affected the outcomes of past Kickstarter campaigns.  In particular, the effect of campaign launch time (by month) and goal amount of funding were examined.  In addition to conducting a numerical analysis in Excel, graphs were created to visualize the relationship between campaign outcome and target funding, or campaign outcome and month of campaign launch.  Although this project was completed with data from theater campaigns, the included PivotTables can be customized to show trends in campaign outcomes for many different fields (for example, tech products or films).  Understanding the trends observed in this project can help optimize future Kickstarter campaigns.

**Analysis and Challenges** For deliverable #1, 1369 past theater campaigns were analyzed based on outcome and launch date.  The following PivotTable was created in order to show a complete breakdown of data:

**Results** From the PivotTable, it appears that 839 campaigns out of 1369 (~61%) were successful in raising their goal funding.   A small percentage (3%) of theater campaigns created were ultimately canceled, and the remaining ~36% had a failed outcome.  In addition, the highest number of campaigns are historically launched in summer months (May, June, and July).  A line graph was also created from the PivotTable to visually depict the trends present:

Based on the line graph, the highest proportion of successful theater campaigns occur in May.  Campaigns launched in May and June historically obtain 100% of their campaign goal, and July campaigns reach ~90% of their goal.  A steady decline in successful campaigns is seen from May until September, until a modest increase in October and another decrease until December.
