# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends

**Overview of Project** This purpose of this project was to examine how various factors affect the outcome of previous Kickstarter campaigns.  In particular, the effect of campaign launch time (by month) and goal amount of funding were examined.  In addition to numerical analysis, graphs were created to visualize the relationship between campaign outcome and target funding, or campaign outcome and month of campaign launch.  Lastly, PivotTables were created to allow for a more customizable analysis of campaign factors.  Understanding the trends observed in this project can help to optimize future Kickstarter campaigns.
