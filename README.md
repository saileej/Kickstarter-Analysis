# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends

**Overview of Project**
This project analyzed how different factors influence the outcome of Kickstarter campaigns. In particular, time of year and goal amount of funding were examined.  After analyzing numerical data, graphs were created to visualize the relationship between campaign outcome (whether the goal amount of funding was raised) and target funding or the month of campaign launch.  PivotTables were also created to allow for more customizable analysis factors affecting campaign outcome.
